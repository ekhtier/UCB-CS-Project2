## Assessment, Analysis and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the attack to the vulnerable VM. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.
Then, I interpreted log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I had successfully performed.
